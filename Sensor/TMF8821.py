        4.3 Measure Command
        After the configuration through the configuration pages and the loading of factory calibration data the
        device is ready for measurements.
            1. Make sure to enable the correct interrupts you want to receive. Enable interrupts for results, set
               the register INT_ENAB to 0x02 if you only want to receive result interrupts, set it to 0x62 if you
               want to receive also error/warning and command done interrupts (see the datasheet for more
               details): S 41 W E2 02 P or S 41 W E2 62 P
            2. Clear any old pending interrupts: S 41 W E1 FF P
            3. The starting of measurements is done by issuing the command MEASURE: S 41 W 08 10 P
            4. The host should check that the command is accepted by reading back the register CMD_STAT:
               S 41 W 08 Sr 41 R N P. This should read back as 0x01 (if a value >= 0x10 is read back then the
               host should continue to read this register, if a value < 0x10 and not 0x01 is returned this is an
